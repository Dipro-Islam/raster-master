      <p>*Manai Mukherjee* is a dedicated mother, teacher, and researcher whose work with *Raster Master* projects is
        driven by compassion and a profound understanding of marginalized communities' needs. Under the guidance of
        Research Director Deep Narayan Nayak, she combines the precision of a researcher with the intuitive insight of a
        mother, embodying the motto: "Where researchers measure, mothers know; where policymakers plan, grandmothers
        sow."
      </p>
      <p>Manai’s research focuses on creating inclusive, accessible, and culturally grounded learning environments,
        empowering mothers and grandmothers as core pillars of community knowledge and strength. Her commitment to the
        *Raster Master* mission reflects a deep belief in the transformative power of education and intergenerational
        learning to break cycles of poverty and illiteracy.</p>
