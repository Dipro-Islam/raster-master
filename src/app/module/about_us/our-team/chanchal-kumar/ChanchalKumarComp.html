      <p>*Dr. Chanchal Kumar Biswas* *Advisor, Raster Master International Foundation* As an advisor to the Raster
        Master International Foundation, I am deeply honored to contribute my experience and insights to support our
        mission of empowering marginalized communities through education. With over 20 years of teaching in higher
        education institute as an Assistant Professor followed by Associate Professor of Botany at B.B. College in
        Asansol, West Bengal</p>

      <p>I have dedicated my career to fostering knowledge, curiosity, and compassion in my students. Additionally my
        role as the Coordinator for Netaji Subhas Open University (NSOU), B. B. College Learner Support Centre for the
        past one decade, I have had the privilege of guiding countless learners, helping them grow with the support and
        encouragement they need to reach their fullest potential. Among all the students I have had the pleasure to
        mentor, Deep Narayan Nayak has always held a special place in my heart. I have known Narayan for over 20 years,
        and he has consistently impressed me with his intellectual rigor, empathy, and unwavering commitment to creating
        positive social impact.</p>

      <p>He is not only an exceptional student but also a remarkable individual with a unique depth of humanity. Beyond
        his academic achievements, he stands out for his kindness and dedication to personal growth and service to
        others. Now, as we work together at Raster Master, I feel immense pride and joy in collaborating with Deep on
        impactful initiatives that truly reflect our shared values and vision. Serving as an advisor to Raster Master is
        a deeply fulfilling extension of my lifelong dedication to education and community development. Witnessing
        Deep’s transformation from a student to a visionary leader in education fills me with profound satisfaction, as
        I see him making meaningful contributions to society on a larger scale. Through my role at Raster Master, I
        remain committed to inspiring, supporting, and uplifting the next generation. This work reinforces my unwavering
        belief in the transformative power of education to bring about positive, lasting change.</p>
