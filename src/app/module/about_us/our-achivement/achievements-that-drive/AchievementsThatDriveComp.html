      <p>In addition to the Global Impact Award, we have been honored with the <b>Sustainable Development Excellence Award</b>,
        recognizing our commitment to environmental sustainability and health. This award highlights our work in SDG
        3—Good Health and Well-being, particularly our initiatives in maternal and child health, as well as our
        environmental conservation efforts under SDG 13—Climate Action and SDG 15—Life on Land. Our tree plantation and
        clean water initiatives have been particularly noted for their long-term impact on communities and ecosystems.
        "Awards may shine a light on our achievements, but they also illuminate the path forward."</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">"Each award inspires us to keep pushing boundaries, innovating, and making a lasting difference."</p>
