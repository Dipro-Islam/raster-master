      <p>The Health and Nutrition Center in Nairobi is the backbone of our health and nutrition programs. Here, we
        develop strategies and coordinate efforts to improve health outcomes in underprivileged communities. Aligned
        with SDG 3—Good Health and Well-being and SDG 2—Zero Hunger, this center has successfully provided nutritional
        support to over 15,000 children and healthcare services to more than 25,000 individuals. Our Nairobi team works
        on initiatives such as maternal and child health programs, community nutrition education, and disease prevention
        campaigns, ensuring that everyone has access to the care and nutrition they need to thrive. "Health is the
        greatest gift, contentment the greatest wealth."</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">"At our Health and Nutrition Center, we are nurturing the bodies and minds of tomorrow’s leaders."</p>
