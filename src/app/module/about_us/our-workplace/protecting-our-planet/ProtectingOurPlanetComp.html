      <p>Our Environmental Sustainability Office in Rio de Janeiro is where we design and implement projects that focus
        on environmental conservation and sustainability. This workplace is dedicated to initiatives that align with SDG
        13—Climate Action and SDG 15—Life on Land, including reforestation, sustainable agriculture, and clean energy
        projects. The Rio team has been instrumental in planting over 100,000 trees and restoring 500 hectares of
        degraded land in the Amazon. Additionally, they work on raising awareness and educating communities about the
        importance of protecting natural resources and adopting sustainable practices. "The Earth does not belong to us;
        we belong to the Earth."</p>
      <p class="fw-bold">"At our Environmental Sustainability Office, we are planting the seeds for a greener future."</p>
