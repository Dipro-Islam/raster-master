      <p>The Three-Generation Research Model introduced by Rastar Master exemplifies a unique, democratic approach to
        community-driven research. This model brings together three generations—children, parents, and grandparents—each
        contributing distinct perspectives and invaluable real-life experiences. The essence of this approach lies in
        the belief that research is not solely the domain of scholars or professionals; rather, it’s an inclusive,
        community-centered activity where every voice matters. Lead researchers and scholar teams guide the process, but
        the real power comes from Indigenous community members, whose daily interactions and insights enrich the
        research with authenticity and immediacy. Reversal learning in the Three-Generation Model is a powerful dynamic
        that enriches the traditional flow of knowledge by facilitating a bidirectional learning experience among
        children, parents, and grandparents. In this model, younger generations are not just passive recipients of
        wisdom; instead, they play active roles in teaching new skills and perspectives to the older generations,
        particularly in areas like digital literacy, modern education, and innovative problem-solving techniques.</p>

      <p>For instance, children adept at using technology often guide their parents and grandparents in navigating
        digital tools, thereby enhancing the family’s collective skill set and adaptability. This process is crucial for
        empowering older generations to stay connected and engaged in an increasingly digital world, bridging
        generational gaps and fostering mutual respect. At the same time, parents and grandparents impart life lessons,
        cultural knowledge, and practical skills rooted in experience, creating a reciprocal learning environment that
        builds resilience, adaptability, and collaboration. By promoting reversal learning, the Three-Generation Model
        fosters a supportive, interdependent community where knowledge flows in multiple directions, making the learning
        process richer and more relevant for everyone involved.For instance, a mother’s intuitive understanding of her
        child’s needs or a grandparent’s knowledge of local traditions and health practices serve as forms of evidence
        often absent from formal research. This grassroots model transcends conventional frameworks by validating life
        skills, experiential insights, and real-time observations as critical data. Each generation’s unique
        contribution ensures a comprehensive, interwoven narrative, producing findings that resonate deeply with the
        community. By democratizing research, the Three-Generation Model not only strengthens the quality and relevance
        of evidence but also promotes gender equity, empowering women and youth to lead in discovering and addressing
        their community’s needs.</p>
