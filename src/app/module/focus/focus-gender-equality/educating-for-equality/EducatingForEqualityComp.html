      <p>Education is the most powerful tool for achieving gender equality. According to the UN’s SDG 4, quality
        education for all is crucial in eliminating gender disparities. Educated women are more likely to earn higher
        incomes, participate in decision-making, and ensure that their children are educated. At Teacher of the Streets,
        we focus on educating both boys and girls about the importance of gender equality, ensuring that the next
        generation grows up with respect for all. Our awareness campaigns address issues like gender-based violence,
        early marriage, and women’s rights, creating a culture of equality and respect. "Educating a girl changes her
        life; educating a community about equality changes the world."
