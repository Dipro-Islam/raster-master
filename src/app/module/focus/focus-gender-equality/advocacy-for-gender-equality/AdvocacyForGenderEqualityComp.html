      <p><b>Impact:</b><br>
        Our <b>Coastal and River Clean-Up Campaigns</b> have mobilized over 3,000 volunteers to remove more than 10 tons of
        waste from local rivers and coastal areas. This project has not only improved water quality and local ecosystems
        but has also raised awareness about the impact of pollution on aquatic life. Local communities have taken
        ownership of keeping their waterways clean, fostering a long-term commitment to environmental stewardship.
