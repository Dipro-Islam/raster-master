      <p><b>Impact:</b><br>
        Through our Advocacy for Gender Equality and Rights initiatives, we have educated over 4,000 women and men on
        the importance of gender equality, human rights, and women’s empowerment. Our awareness campaigns have led to
        tangible changes in social attitudes and behaviors, with more families encouraging women and girls to pursue
        education and careers. This advocacy work is breaking down long-standing barriers and creating a more equitable
        society.</p>
