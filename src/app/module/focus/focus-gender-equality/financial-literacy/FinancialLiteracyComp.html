        The Financial Literacy and Microfinance Programs have equipped over 2,500 women with the knowledge to manage
        their finances, save for the future, and access microloans to start small businesses. Many participants have
        successfully utilized their new financial skills to escape the cycle of debt and poverty, building a more secure
        future for themselves and their families. This initiative has created a culture of economic empowerment, where
        women take control of their financial destinies.
