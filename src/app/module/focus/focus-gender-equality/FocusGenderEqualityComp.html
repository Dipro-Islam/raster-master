    </div>
    <div class="gender-equality-details-desc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="1s">
      <p>Gender equality is fundamental to achieving a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world. According to the
        UN’s SDG 5, gender equality is not only a basic human right but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, thriving
        society. When women and girls are empowered, entire communities benefit, as they play critical roles in driving
        economic growth and social progress. Yet, globally, women are still paid 23% less than men, and only 1 in 4
        parliamentarians is a woman. Ensuring equal rights and opportunities for all genders is key to unlocking the
        full potential of societies. "A world that is good for women is good for everyone. Let’s make gender equality a
        reality."

      <h2>Understanding the Gender Divide: Where We Stand</h2>
      <p>Despite significant progress, gender inequality remains deeply entrenched in many parts of the world. According
        to UN data, women represent 70% of the global health workforce but earn 11% less than their male counterparts.
        In India, women make up only 20.5% of the labor force, and gender-based violence remains a pervasive issue, with
        1 in 3 women experiencing physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. These statistics underscore the urgent
        need for comprehensive strategies to address the structural barriers that women and girls face daily. "The
        journey toward gender equality is long, but every step brings us closer to a world where all people can live
        with dignity and freedom."</p>

      <p>Handicrafts are more than just beautiful creations; they are a source of empowerment for women in rural areas.
        At Teacher of the Streets, we support women artisans by providing them with the training, tools, and market

        only preserve cultural heritage but also provide a path out of poverty. The UN’s SDG 8 emphasizes the importance
        of promoting local culture and crafts as a means of economic growth. "Every stitch, every thread tells a story
        of resilience and empowerment. Through their craft, these women are weaving a brighter future."
