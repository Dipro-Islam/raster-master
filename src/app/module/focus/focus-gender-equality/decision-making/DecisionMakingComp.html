      <p><b>Impact:</b><br>
        Our Leadership and Decision-Making Workshops have trained over 1,000 women in rural and urban areas to take
        leadership roles in their communities and advocate for their rights. Participants have gone on to lead local
        councils, establish women's cooperatives, and influence policy decisions that directly impact their lives. This
        program is helping to reshape gender dynamics, ensuring that women's voices are heard and respected in
        decision-making spaces.</p>
