      <p>Economic empowerment is key to achieving gender equality. According to the UNâ€™s SDG 8, promoting sustained,
        inclusive, and sustainable economic growth requires providing equal opportunities for all. However, globally,
        women are underrepresented in the workforce and face significant barriers to economic participation. At Teacher
        of the Streets, we provide women with the skills, resources, and opportunities they need to succeed in the
        workplace. Through vocational training, entrepreneurship programs, and support networks, we help women overcome
        obstacles and achieve financial independence. "Empowered women empower communities. When women succeed, we all
        succeed."
