      <p><b>Impact:</b><br>
        Through our <b>Clean Energy and Solar Power Projects</b>, we have installed solar panels in 10 schools and
        community
        centers, providing renewable energy to areas with limited access to electricity. This project has reduced
        reliance on non-renewable energy sources, saving an estimated 50 tons of carbon emissions annually. Communities
        now have access to clean, reliable energy, improving their quality of life while promoting sustainable energy
        practices.
