      <p>Quality education is a fundamental right, as highlighted by the UN’s SDG 4, which aims to ensure inclusive and
        equitable quality education for all. Despite this, 617 million children and adolescents worldwide are not
        achieving minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics. At Teacher of the Streets, we provide children with
        the knowledge and skills they need to unlock their full potential. Through our innovative educational programs,
        we are breaking down barriers and opening doors to a world of opportunities. "Education is the most powerful
        weapon you can use to change the world. Let’s equip every child with it."</p>
