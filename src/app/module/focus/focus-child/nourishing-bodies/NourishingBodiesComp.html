      <p>Good nutrition is the cornerstone of a healthy life, and it’s crucial for the physical and cognitive
        development of children. The UN’s SDG 2 aims to end hunger and ensure access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious
        food for all. However, 149 million children under the age of 5 are stunted due to chronic malnutrition. At
        Teacher of the Streets, we are committed to providing balanced nutrition to children in underprivileged
        communities, ensuring they have the energy and strength to pursue their dreams. "A well-nourished child is a
        thriving child. Let’s feed their bodies and their futures."</p>
