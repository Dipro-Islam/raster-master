      <p>In response to the ongoing global pandemic, <b>Teacher of the Streets</b> is committed to safeguarding the health and
        well-being of underprivileged communities through our Corona Test Camps. These camps provide free COVID-19
        testing to individuals who may lack access to healthcare services, ensuring early detection and helping to curb
        the spread of the virus in vulnerable areas. Since the start of the pandemic, our <b>Corona Test Camps</b> have played
        a pivotal role in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in underserved communities. By providing free testing, we
        ensure that even the most marginalized individuals have access to this life-saving service. Our camps have not
        only identified and isolated positive cases but also provided communities with the knowledge they need to stay
        safe.</p>
