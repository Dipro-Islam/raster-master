      <p>Every child deserves to grow up in a safe, nurturing environment. The UNâ€™s SDG 16 emphasizes the importance of
        promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, ensuring that children are protected from violence and exploitation.
        Shockingly, over 1 billion children experience violence each year. At Teacher of the Streets, we prioritize the
        care and protection of children, offering them a safe haven where they can receive the love and support they
        need to flourish. "To care for a child is to shape the future. Together, we can create a world where every child
        feels loved and secure."</p>
