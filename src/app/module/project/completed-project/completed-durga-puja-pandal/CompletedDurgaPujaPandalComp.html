      <p>In celebration of Durga Puja, Rastar Master sponsored and organized a traditional pandal, creating a sacred
        space for community worship, celebration, and unity. The pandal brought together families and friends,
        reinforcing cultural bonds and offering a reprieve from daily hardships. Although no longer active, this project
        fostered a sense of belonging and cultural pride, bringing the community closer in times of celebration and
        faith.</p>
