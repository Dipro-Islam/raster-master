      <p>The <b>Nutritional Support Project by Rastar Master</b> is dedicated to addressing malnutrition and ensuring
        access to nutritious food for vulnerable children and mothers in underserved communities. This project focuses
        on improving physical and cognitive development by providing essential nutrients that many children and families
        lack due to economic hardship or limited access to fresh, nutritious food.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center">Why Nutritional Support is Essential</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="details-desc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="1s">
      <p>Research highlights that proper nutrition during the first 1,000 days (from conception to two years) is
        critical, as it influences a child’s lifelong health, learning capacity, and productivity. According to UNICEF,
        malnutrition contributes to nearly 45% of deaths in children under five. Malnourished children are also at a
        greater risk of infections, developmental delays, and poor academic performance. Our Nutritional Support Project
        aims to combat these challenges, ensuring children have the nutrition they need to grow, thrive, and achieve
        their full potential.</p>

      <ol class="number-list">
        <li>
          <p><b>Nutritious Meals and Supplements:</b> We provide balanced meals enriched with essential vitamins and
            minerals, tailored to meet the needs of growing children and lactating mothers. Meals include fruits,
            vegetables, protein sources, grains, and iron-rich foods to promote comprehensive health.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Nutritional Supplements:</b> To combat deficiencies in critical nutrients such as iron, Vitamin A, and
            calcium, we distribute supplements where food alone may not suffice. These supplements address common
            deficiencies that lead to issues like anemia, weakened immune systems, and stunted growth.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><b>Education on Balanced Diets:</b> Education is a core part of our program. Through workshops, we teach
            families about the importance of a balanced diet, how to use locally available foods to create nutritious
            meals, and how to maintain food hygiene. Empowering parents, particularly mothers, with knowledge about
            nutrition creates a sustainable impact, enabling them to make healthier choices for their families.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Monitoring and Growth Tracking:</b> We conduct regular health screenings and track the growth and
            development of participating children to assess the impact of our interventions. Children’s height, weight,
            and other indicators are recorded, helping us adapt the program as needed and identify any persistent
            nutritional gaps.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Community Gardens and Local Farming Support:</b> To make fresh produce more accessible, we support
            community gardens and teach sustainable farming practices. By growing their own fruits and vegetables,
            communities can improve food security and reduce dependency on external food sources, contributing to
            long-term sustainability.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="details-desc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="1s">
      <p>Since its inception, the Nutritional Support Project has significantly improved the health outcomes of children
        and mothers in our target communities. Studies show that children receiving balanced diets demonstrate 40%
        better cognitive performance and 20% higher school attendance rates. Families participating in the program
        report increased energy levels, improved immune function, and greater overall well-being. Additionally, mothers
        with improved nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding have healthier pregnancies and babies with stronger
        growth trajectories.</p>
