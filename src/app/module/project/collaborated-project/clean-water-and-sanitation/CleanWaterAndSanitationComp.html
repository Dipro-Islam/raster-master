      <p>The Clean Water and Sanitation Project, which aligns with SDG 6—Clean Water and Sanitation. Collaborating with
        health organizations and local authorities, we installed rainwater harvesting systems and community wells in
        regions plagued by water scarcity. This project has provided access to clean, safe drinking water to over 5,000
        villagers, reducing waterborne diseases by 30% and improving overall community health.</p>
      <p>"Every project is a story of hope—hope for a better, more sustainable world."</p>
