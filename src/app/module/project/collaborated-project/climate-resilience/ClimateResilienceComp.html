      <p>our Climate Resilience and Reforestation Initiative aligns with SDG 13—Climate Action and SDG 15—Life on Land.
        This project was a collaborative effort with environmental NGOs, local governments, and community organizations,
        focusing on combating deforestation and promoting sustainable land use. To date, we’ve planted over 100,000
        trees and restored 500 hectares of degraded land. This effort has contributed to a 15% increase in local
        biodiversity and a significant reduction in soil erosion, benefiting both the environment and the local
        communities.</p>
