      <p>Improving sanitation is crucial for public health, especially in rural areas. Our <b>Rural Infrastructure
        Development</b> project will focus on building toilets and improving sanitation in underserved villages, aiming to
        reduce open defecation and provide access to clean and safe sanitation facilities. This project will prioritize
        schools and public spaces, ensuring that communities, especially women and children, have access to dignified,
        hygienic spaces</p>
